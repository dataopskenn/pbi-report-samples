# Title: Power BI Report - Car Sales Analysis
## PACE Strategy Document

# Plan:

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive Power BI report that analyzes various aspects of car sales, including the total number of cars sold, total revenue generated, and average revenue, based on different factors such as car body type, car listing type, year of manufacture, car category, and car condition. Additionally, the report should incorporate different clusters based on "no cluster", "Total Sales", "Total Revenue", and "Average Revenue" for the cars.


### Stakeholders:
- Senior Management Team
- Sales Department
- Marketing Department
- Product Management Team


### Data Sources:
The required data for this analysis will be sourced from the company's internal sales database. It should include information such as car details, sales records, revenue figures, and relevant attributes for analysis.


### Key Metrics and Dimensions:
#### Metrics:
- Total Sales
- Total Revenue
- Average Revenue

#### Dimensions:
- Car Body Type
- Car Listing Type
- Year of Manufacture
- Car Category
- Car Condition


# Analyze:

- Assess the quality, completeness, and accuracy of the data.
- Identify any potential data gaps or inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

### Identify Key Insights:
- Explore relationships between various dimensions and metrics.
- Identify any notable trends, and patterns in the data.
- Determine the impact of different dimensions on sales and revenue.


# Construct:

### Data Modeling:
- Transform and clean the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- Create appropriate data models and relationships between different tables.
- Define measures and calculated fields to facilitate calculations and aggregations.
- Report Design:

### Create a visually appealing and intuitive report layout.
- Select suitable visualizations (e.g., charts, tables, maps) to present the data effectively.
- Organize the report sections logically, aligning with the outlined structure.

### Interactive Features:
- Incorporate interactive elements such as slicers, filters, and drill-through options.
- Enable users to explore the data based on their specific requirements.
- Implement dynamic features to enhance the user experience.


# Execute:

### Data Integration:

- Maintain up-to-date documentation to facilitate future maintenance and knowledge transfer.

### Timeline:
- Develop a detailed timeline outlining key milestones and deliverables for each phase of the project.
- Ensure sufficient time for data exploration, report construction, testing, and refinement.
- Allow for iterations and feedback cycles to accommodate stakeholder input.

### Communication:
- Regularly communicate project progress and updates to the stakeholders.
- Conduct periodic meetings or status reports to discuss any challenges or roadblocks.
- Ensure effective communication channels to address queries or concerns promptly.
