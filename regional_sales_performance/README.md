Comparing the sales performance of the different regions a business has made sales across different continents using a scatterplot

# E-commerce Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the sales data for [Company Name], an e-commerce company. The analysis will focus on comparing the "Percentage Gross Margin GM(%)" for the current year and the "Percentage Change in Net Sales" for the previous year against the "Sales" for the current year in USD. The analysis will be conducted across five distinct clusters: "All Clusters at the same time," "GM(%) Levels," "GM(%) Above/Below 0," "PY(%) Above/Below 0," as well as across different continents.

## Framework Selection
For the successful execution of this project, we will employ the PACE framework (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute). This framework provides a systematic approach to guide us through the various stages of the analysis process, ensuring efficient and effective results.

## PACE Framework

### Plan
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly define the scope of the analysis, including the specific sales data variables to be examined, namely "Percentage Gross Margin GM(%)," "Percentage Change in Net Sales," and "Sales" for the current year in USD.
- **Cluster Identification:** Determine the five clusters for analysis: "All Clusters at the same time," "GM(%) Levels," "GM(%) Above/Below 0," and "PY(%) Above/Below 0." Additionally, consider analyzing the data across different continents.
- **Time Period Specification:** Define the time range for the analysis, considering the current year for "Percentage Gross Margin GM(%)" and "Sales" in USD, and the previous year for "Percentage Change in Net Sales."
- **Data Gathering:** Identify and collect the necessary sales data, ensuring its quality and integrity. Collect data related to "Percentage Gross Margin GM(%)," "Percentage Change in Net Sales," and "Sales" for the current year in USD.

### Analyze
- **Calculation of "Percentage Gross Margin GM(%)" for the Current Year:** Compute the gross margin percentage for each sale in the current year by dividing the gross margin by the sales and multiplying by 100.
- **Calculation of "Percentage Change in Net Sales" for the Previous Year:** Determine the percentage change in net sales for each sale by subtracting the previous year's net sales from the current year's net sales, dividing by the previous year's net sales, and multiplying by 100.
- **Data Grouping into Clusters:** Categorize the sales data into the predefined clusters based on "GM(%)" levels, "GM(%)" above/below 0, and "PY(%)" above/below 0. Additionally, group the data by continents.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Perform statistical analysis, including calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for each cluster and continent. Identify any significant differences or trends across the clusters and continents.

### Construct
- **Data Visualization:** Create visually appealing and informative charts, graphs, and other visualizations to represent the analysis results effectively. Utilize bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and maps to display the findings for each cluster and continent.
- **Report Preparation:** Document the analysis process, findings, and insights in a comprehensive report. Include a detailed explanation of each cluster and continent's performance based on "Percentage Gross Margin GM(%)," "Percentage Change in Net Sales," and "Sales" in USD. Present any significant observations, trends, or correlations discovered during the analysis.

### Execute
- **Report Sharing:** Present the analysis report to the relevant stakeholders, including management, executives, or decision-makers. Clearly communicate the key findings, insights, and recommendations derived from the analysis. Provide actionable recommendations to improve sales performance based on the identified trends.
