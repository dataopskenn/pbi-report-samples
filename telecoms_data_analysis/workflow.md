# Overall Workflow
The notebook is structured into several key sections that mirror an enterprise‐grade data analysis pipeline:


## Data Ingestion & Quality Checks

#### Purpose: 
To load and validate the data before any analysis is performed.

#### What We Do:
- We simulate a “FactTable” (which holds key network performance and customer engagement metrics) and a “TimeDimension” (to provide a temporal context).
- We merge these tables so that each record in the FactTable can be analyzed in a time series context.
- We then perform data quality checks (missing values, duplicates, and basic descriptive statistics) to ensure our dataset is reliable.

#### Why: 
Data quality is the foundation for any analysis. If the input data is flawed, downstream insights will be unreliable. In a real enterprise setting, additional validation tools (e.g., Great Expectations) would be used.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Purpose: 
To get an initial understanding of the data’s distributions and identify any obvious issues or patterns.

#### What We Do:
- We generate histograms and density plots for key variables like Latency, Throughput, CallDropRate, DataUsage, and CustomerSatisfaction.

#### Why: 
These metrics are central to telecom performance. For example; 
- Latency, CallDropRate, and Throughput directly affect the network’s performance.
- DataUsage reflects customer behavior.
- CustomerSatisfaction is a direct indicator of how users feel about the service.

#### Actionable Insight: 
Abnormal distributions (e.g., heavy tails, skewness) might signal issues that need attention or transformation.


## Advanced Univariate Analysis

#### Purpose: 
To drill down into individual variables using statistical tests and outlier detection.

#### What We Do:
- We use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if Latency is normally distributed.
- We detect outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

#### Why:
- Normality testing helps us decide on subsequent statistical methods (e.g., whether parametric tests are appropriate).
- Outlier detection is crucial because extreme values can skew model performance.

#### Actionable Insight: 
If many outliers are present or if the data is highly non-normal, we might choose to transform the data (e.g., with a log transformation) or use robust statistical methods.


## Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

## Purpose: 
To explore relationships between variables and reduce dimensionality where possible.

#### What We Do:
- We compute the Pearson correlation between Latency and CustomerSatisfaction to understand if poorer network performance (high latency) correlates with lower satisfaction.
- We generate pair plots to visually inspect pairwise relationships among key metrics.
- We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a subset of features (Latency, Throughput, CallDropRate, DataUsage) to understand how much of the variance in the data can be captured by a few dimensions.

#### Why:
- Understanding correlations helps identify which network metrics are most likely driving customer satisfaction.
- PCA can simplify complex datasets and help focus modeling efforts on the most influential factors.

#### Actionable Insight: 
These analyses guide feature selection for predictive modeling.


## Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

#### Purpose: 
To examine how key metrics change over time and to forecast future network load.

#### What We Do:
- We aggregate data on a daily basis and plot trends for average Latency and total DataUsage.
- We perform seasonal decomposition on DataUsage to extract trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- We analyze autocorrelation (ACF and PACF) to assess how current values relate to past values.
- We use Prophet to forecast future daily DataUsage for 30 days.

#### Why:
- Telecom networks are highly time-sensitive. Trends in data usage and latency can indicate peak hours, seasonal patterns, or unexpected anomalies.
- Forecasting helps in capacity planning and scheduling maintenance during predicted low-usage periods.

#### Actionable Insight: 
These insights support proactive resource allocation and maintenance planning.


## Statistical Hypothesis Testing

#### Purpose: 
To validate whether observed differences in metrics are statistically significant.

#### What We Do:
- We split the data into groups (e.g., high versus low latency based on the median) and perform a t-test on CustomerSatisfaction between these groups.
- We demonstrate a chi-square test to explore associations between categorical variables (e.g., a dummy example using network type and latency group).

#### Why:
Hypothesis tests provide statistical confidence that observed differences (such as lower satisfaction in high latency conditions) are not due to random chance.

#### Actionable Insight: 
Validated differences justify targeted interventions (e.g., investing in network improvements in areas with high latency).

## Feature Engineering & Data Transformation

#### Purpose: 
To prepare the data for modeling by improving its quality and stability.

#### What We Do:
We apply a log transformation to DataUsage to reduce skewness.

#### Why:
Many machine learning models assume a roughly normal distribution. Transforming skewed variables often improves model accuracy and interpretability.

#### Actionable Insight: 
Transformed features typically lead to more robust and accurate predictive models.

## Advanced Predictive Modeling & Experiment Tracking

#### Purpose: 
To build a model that predicts CustomerSatisfaction based on network performance metrics and to track experiments.

#### What We Do:
- We create a pipeline that scales the data and trains a Random Forest model.
- We use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- We log model parameters and performance metrics using MLflow.

#### Why:
- A robust predictive model can highlight which metrics most strongly influence customer satisfaction, guiding operational improvements.
- MLflow enables reproducibility and continuous improvement of models in a production environment.

#### Actionable Insight: 
The model’s feature importances help prioritize network improvements that will likely boost customer satisfaction.


## Enhanced Clustering & Segmentation:

#### Purpose: 
To segment customers based on behavior and usage patterns.

#### What We Do:
- We select features such as DataUsage, NumberOfCalls, SessionDuration, CustomerSatisfaction, and ARPU for clustering.
- We normalize these features and use K-Means clustering.
- We evaluate the optimal number of clusters using the silhouette score.

#### Why:
Segmenting customers allows the company to tailor support, marketing, and service plans for different user groups (e.g., high-value customers vs. casual users).

#### Actionable Insight: 
Customized strategies based on customer segmentation can improve retention and increase revenue.


## Anomaly Detection & Impact Analysis

## Purpose: 
To detect unusual network events that could affect service quality and to assess their impact.

#### What We Do:
- We use Isolation Forest to identify anomalies in metrics like Latency, PacketLoss, and Jitter.
- We then bin Downtime into categories (Low, Moderate, High) and analyze how these categories relate to CustomerSatisfaction and Revenue.

#### Why:
- Early detection of anomalies enables rapid response to network issues.
- Understanding the impact of downtime helps justify investments in network resiliency.

#### Actionable Insight: 
Real-time anomaly detection can trigger alerts and facilitate rapid intervention, minimizing service disruption.


## Interactive Dashboard Prototyping:

#### Purpose: 
To create visual, interactive dashboards for monitoring key metrics.

#### What We Do:
We use Plotly to build an interactive line chart showing daily DataUsage trends.

#### Why:
Dashboards make it easy for decision-makers to monitor performance in real time.

#### Actionable Insight: 
Real-time dashboards support proactive management by providing immediate insights into network performance.
