Project: Power BI Report Design

Objective: Create an official Power BI report that showcases the top 5 best-selling brands, countries, and products, analyzes brand and product performance based on customer feedback ratings and price ratings, performs regional profitability analysis, and includes year-on-year analysis using data from 2017 to 2019.


<strong>Plan Phase:</strong> <br>
Define project scope: Precisely outline the desired metrics, visualizations, and analysis to be included in the Power BI report.
Identify data sources: Recognize the Adventure Works 2019 Data Warehouse available on the internet as the primary data source for retrieving information on brand sales, country sales, product sales, customer feedback ratings, brand price ratings, regional profitability, and year-on-year data.
Assess resources: Evaluate the resources required for data extraction, transformation, and visualization, including any additional software or tools needed.
Establish project timeline: Create a well-defined project schedule that encompasses key milestones and deadlines for each phase of the report design, ensuring adherence to the established timeline.


<strong>Analyze Phase:</strong> <br>
Collect and analyze data: Extract the relevant data from the Adventure Works 2019 Data Warehouse, covering the period between 2017 and 2019. Thoroughly cleanse and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Define key metrics: Determine the critical metrics to measure brand sales, country sales, product sales, customer feedback ratings, brand price ratings, regional profitability, and year-on-year performance.
Determine visualization requirements: Identify the most suitable visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, and tables that effectively represent the data and insights to be presented.


<strong>Construct Phase:</strong> <br>
Design report layout: Develop a professional visual layout for the Power BI report, meticulously considering the placement of visualizations, filters, and interactive elements to optimize user experience.
Create data models: Formulate robust data models that seamlessly integrate the Adventure Works 2019 Data Warehouse and enable efficient data exploration and analysis.
Build visualizations: Construct visually appealing and informative visualizations that effectively highlight the top 5 best-selling brands, countries, and products. Implement brand and product performance analysis based on customer feedback ratings and price ratings. Include comprehensive regional profitability analysis and year-on-year analysis.


<strong>Execute Phase:</strong> <br>
Implement report design: Meticulously build the Power BI report in accordance with the defined layout and visualizations. Establish solid connections between the data models and the visual elements.
Test and validate: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the accuracy and functionality of the report. Verify that the visualizations present the desired insights and that filters and interactions perform as intended.
Refine and finalize: Incorporate any feedback or enhancements identified during the testing phase. Continuously refine the report design, data models, and visualizations to ensure a polished final product.
Publish and distribute: Deploy the final Power BI report to the intended audience or stakeholders, giving credit to Adventure Works for providing the Adventure Works 2019 Data Warehouse. If necessary, provide documentation or training to facilitate effective utilization of the report.
Throughout the project, maintaining effective communication with stakeholders is vital. Regularly seek feedback, iterate on the design as required, and monitor project progress against the established timeline.
